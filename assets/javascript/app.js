//Make the button begin the function that runs the quiz.

//When the game begins, javascript should clear the DOM's title page and add the first question to the existing div's.

//After the question is displayed, a timer should appear that counts down from 30 to 0

//If the player has not clicked an answer before the timer reaches 0 or selects the wrong answer, add one to wrong answers

//If the player selects the correct answer, add one to right answers.

//Once the player selects an answer, the next question should load.

//After all questions have been answered, the DOM should change to a final screen that shows how many correct answers the player had.
